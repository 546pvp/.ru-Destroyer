# This script
<hr>
was created so you can get rid of those **.ru** websites with a lot of popups.
The _blockedDomains_ array is small, so if you know some another **.ru** websites you can share in the comments.

## What this script does:
- Script checks if hostname is is the _blockedDomains_ array. If it is, it edits the HTML and adds warning message.


## What it doesn't do:
- Takes your information
